1. Go to Window -> Git (to open the Git for Unity tab) and select the Settings tab
2. Set your name and email
3. Change the repository to YOUR GitHub repository (you can't push to mine anyway)
4. Click either the "Set to bundled git" or "Find system git" button (either should work) -- you will probably have to do this every time you clone your repository as well.
